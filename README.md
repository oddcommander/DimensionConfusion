This mod makes nether mobs attack overworld and end mobs attack nether. Supports 1.16.5 at present and requires Fabric API.
 
In overworld, nether mobs could spawn in caves, and they will target overworld mobs. If no enemy is found, they may move to higher places. Nether portal is banned, and the only way to nether is falling into the void. Therefore, the bedrocks at the bottom of the overworld and at the top of the nether. After falling into the void, you will be teleported in the air where is 30 blocks high, so you need to prepare items to avoid fall damage. In nether, end mobs could spawn in the bottom of the nether, and they will target nether mobs. Strongholds are removed in overworld, and they are composed of blackstone bricks and generate in nether. After entering end portal, you will be teleported in the air where is 30 blocks high like teleporting to nether.
